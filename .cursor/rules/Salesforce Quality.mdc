Technical Hygiene & Quality Standards

Trigger: Apply when reviewing code or preparing a release.

1. Security & Code Analysis

Mandatory Check: Remind the user to run the Salesforce Code Analyzer (SFCA) to identify critical vulnerabilities before publication.

Rule: If you see hardcoded credentials, SOQL injection risks, or DML inside loops, flag them immediately as blocking issues for Open Source publication.

2. Dependencies

No Internal Deps: Ensure the code does not depend on unmanaged packages or components that are not included in the repo (unless they are standard Salesforce features).

Versioning: Remind the user to check sfdx-project.json to ensure the sourceApiVersion matches a currently supported Salesforce release.

3. Governance & Maintenance

Issue Tracking: When discussing repository setup, ensure the user knows to enable the "Issues" tab in GitHub settings.

LLM Rules: Remind the user that this repo should ideally include these Cursor rules (referencing awesome-context) for future maintainers.

4. Coding Style

Ensure Apex classes have Javadoc-style headers.

Ensure LWC components have proper @api documentation.

Verify meta.xml files have valid descriptions.
