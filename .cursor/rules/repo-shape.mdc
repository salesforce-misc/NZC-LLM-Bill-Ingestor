# Project Structure Reference

## Overview
This project contains a comprehensive summary document that provides an LLM-optimized overview of the entire codebase structure, architecture, and components.

## Primary Reference Document
**File**: `REPOSITORY_SUMMARY.md` (located in the project root)

## When to Use
**ALWAYS** read `REPOSITORY_SUMMARY.md` first when you need to:
- Understand the overall project structure
- Learn about the technology stack and architecture
- Identify which components exist and their purposes
- Find relationships between different parts of the codebase
- Get context before making changes or answering questions about the project
- Understand the data model and key objects
- Learn about the deployment and development workflow

## Why This File
The `REPOSITORY_SUMMARY.md` file contains:
- Complete project overview and technology stack
- Detailed component architecture (LWC, Apex, Flows)
- Data model and object relationships
- Key features and functionalities
- Directory structure and organization
- Development guidelines and best practices
- Integration points and external dependencies

This file is specifically formatted to be easily consumable by LLMs, providing quick context without requiring extensive codebase exploration.

## Workflow
1. **First**: Read `REPOSITORY_SUMMARY.md` to understand the project
2. **Then**: Use specific tools (codebase_search, grep, read_file) to dive into relevant components
3. **Finally**: Make informed decisions based on comprehensive context

By following this approach, you'll have better context for all tasks and provide more accurate, architecture-aware responses.
