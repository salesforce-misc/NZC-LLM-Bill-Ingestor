# Project Structure Reference

## Overview
This project is a Salesforce Accelerator for AI-powered bill processing and energy consumption tracking in Net Zero Cloud.

## Project Structure
- **force-app/main/default/**: Main metadata directory
  - **classes/**: Apex classes (controllers, utilities)
  - **lwc/**: Lightning Web Components
  - **flows/**: Salesforce Flows
  - **genAiPromptTemplates/**: Einstein AI prompt templates

## When to Use
When you need to understand the project structure:
1. **First**: Read the `README.md` for project overview and architecture
2. **Then**: Use specific tools (codebase_search, grep, read_file) to explore components
3. **Finally**: Make informed decisions based on comprehensive context

## Key Components
- **imageAnalyzer**: Main LWC component for file upload and AI analysis
- **AIFileAnalysisController**: Apex controller handling AI processing
- **MultipleJSONParser**: Utility for parsing complex JSON structures
- **Process_AI_Analysis_Result**: Flow for additional processing workflows

## Workflow
1. Start with `README.md` for high-level understanding
2. Use `codebase_search` to find related components
3. Read specific files using `read_file` for detailed implementation
4. Use `grep` to find usages and relationships

By following this approach, you'll have better context for all tasks and provide more accurate, architecture-aware responses.
