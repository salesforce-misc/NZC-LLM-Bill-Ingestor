Accelerator README Standards

Trigger: Apply these rules when generating, editing, or reviewing the README.md.

1. Required Structure

The README must strictly follow this outline:

Project Title & Purpose: Clear statement of the business problem solved.

Features: High-level list of capabilities.

Technical Architecture: Overview of metadata (e.g., "Contains 2 LWCs, 1 Apex Class, 1 Flow").

Installation Instructions: (See Section 2 below).

Post-Installation Steps: Manual steps (e.g., Assign Permission Sets, Activate Flows).

How to Report Bugs: Link to GitHub Issues tab.

Disclaimer: "This accelerator is open-source, not an official Salesforce product, and is community-supported."

2. Mandatory Installation Paths

You MUST provide these three specific installation methods in the README:

Path 1: One-Click Deploy (Admin-Friendly)

You must include the "Deploy to Salesforce" button using this exact Markdown pattern (replace users/repo placeholders):

[![Deploy to Salesforce](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afawcett/githubsfdeploy/master/deploy.png)](https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com?owner=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME&repo=YOUR_REPO_NAME&ref=main)


Path 2: Metadata .zip File (Admin-Friendly)

Instruct the user to download the .zip from the GitHub "Releases" tab.

Provide instructions to deploy using Workbench, Salesforce Inspector, or Ant Migration Tool.

Path 3: Pro-Code / CI/CD (Developer-Friendly)

Provide CLI commands:

sf project deploy start --target-org <org-alias>
# OR
sfdx force:source:deploy ...


Mention compatibility with CI/CD tools like Gearset or Copado.

3. Tone and Style

The README is the "Storefront". It must be accessible to Admins (non-coders) and Developers alike.

Do not assume the user knows how to use a CLI for Path 1 or 2.
